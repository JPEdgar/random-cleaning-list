# d20 Tasklist

This is a small project based around an idea of creating a todo list for ADHD people with a d20 theme. The project shows what tasks need to be completed, how much health the boss monster has, and breaks for certain tasks that prove challenging (either mentially, physically, or emotionally). No sound or music was added as I'm sure people who would potentially use this program would have their own music.

Since this is a personal project, no backend servers were created. Instead, the code is laid out as if there were a backend to call from. This is done from the api/index.js file. Note: This file would be a lot cleaner under normal circumstances, but the api file is acting like a server and is emulating general backend functions.
